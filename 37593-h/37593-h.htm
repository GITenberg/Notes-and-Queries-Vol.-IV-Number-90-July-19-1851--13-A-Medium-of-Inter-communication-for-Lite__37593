<h3><span>A CAXTON MEMORIAL SUGGESTED.</span></h3>

<p>After Caxton had slept with his fathers for three centuries, remembered
only by a few antiquaries, it was deemed fit that a public monument
should record his merits.</p>

<p>The Roxburghe club, much to the honour of its members, undertook to bear
the cost of it, and to superintend its execution. With regard to its
location, there was no question as to the paramount claims of
Westminster. It was proposed, in the first instance, to place it in the
collegiate church of St. Peter, within the precincts of which church
Caxton had exercised his art. The want of a convenient space was rather
an obstacle to that plan: a more serious obstacle was the amount of fees
demanded on such occasions. It was then decided, and perhaps with more
propriety, that it should be placed in the parish church of St.
Margaret; and the execution of the monument, which was to be of the
tablet form, was entrusted to the younger Westmacott.<a id="Westmacott1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>  An engraving of
it has been published.<a id="been2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>  The inscription is</p>

 <p class="center">  "<i>To the memory</i></p>
            <p class="center">of William Caxton</p>
   <p class="center">who first introduced into Great Britain</p>
      <p class="center">the art of printing</p>
 <p class="center">and who <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1477 or earlier</p>
          <p class="center">exercised that art</p>
 <p class="center">  in the abbey of Westminster.</p>
            <p class="center">This tablet</p>

          <p class="center"> to whom</p>

   London, 1836. 8vo. i. 386.</p>

<p>The monument, as a piece of sculpture, is simplicity itself, and
therefore suitable to the place of its destination. To the inscription I
venture to make some slight objections: 1. Whether Caxton "introduced
into Great Britain the art of printing" admits of a doubt. There is no
evidence to invalidate the colophon of the <i>Exposicio S. Jeronimi in
simbolo Apostolorum</i>.<a id="posto3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 Dibdin fully believed in its authenticity.<a id="its4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
2. Caxton is very imperfectly designated. He was a well-informed writer,
a most assiduous translator, and a very careful editor. As early as
1548, he was classed among the <i>Illustres majoris Britanniæ
scriptores</i><a id="script5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> &mdash;<a id="but34"></a> but<span class="pagenum">[34]</span> we are on the decline, it seems, in point of
tact and intelligence. 3. The date of his decease, and the place of his
burial, should have been stated. The facts are recorded in the accounts
of the churchwardens of this very parish, and <i>nowhere else</i>.<a id="and6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>  4. The
inscription, as a composition, wants terseness: on this point, I content
myself with giving a hint <i>typographically</i>.</p>

<p>In 1847 a fresh attempt as made to revive the memory of Caxton. After
due notice, a public meeting was held on the 12th of June to "promote
the erection of a monument to commemorate the introduction of printing
into England, and in honour of William Caxton, the earliest English
printer"&mdash;the lord Morpeth in the chair. The meeting was extremely well
attended. The form of monument proposed was, the combination of a
fountain by day and a light by night&mdash;the poetical conception of the
rev. H. H. Milman. Some excellent speeches were made&mdash;and I cannot but
particularize that of the noble chairman; considerable sums were
subscribed&mdash;the messieurs Clowes tendering 100<i>l.</i>; a committee, a
sub-committee, a treasurer, and a secretary, were appointed.<a id="appo7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7." href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> &mdash;With
the proceedings of that meeting, as publicly reported, my information
terminated.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn7"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#appo7" class="label">[7]</a>
 <i>The Times</i>, June 14, 1847.</p>

<p>After a lapse of four years, a meeting of the subscribers to the <i>Caxton
Testimonial</i> was advertised for the 10th of July, to "consider an offer
made by the Coalbrookdale Iron Company to erect an <i>iron statue of
Caxton</i>&mdash;and, in the event of the proposal being adopted, to determine
the best means of carrying the same into effect." I was much astonished
at this announcement. A meeting to consider an offer to perpetuate a
fiction in connexion with an art which surpasses all other arts in its
power of establishing truth! On reflection, I became calm; and felt that
Mr. Henry Cole, the honorary secretary, was perfectly right in adopting
the customary phraseology. The result of this meeting is a desideratum.
It seems to have been private; for an examination of 300 columns of <i>The
Times</i>, being, the history of four days, did not lead to the discovery
of one word on the <i>iron statue of Caxton</i>.</p>

<p>If the statue-mania did not now prevail to an unexampled extent, I
should feel much confidence in the sound sense of the subscribers&mdash;but I
have my misgivings.</p>

<p>According to <i>my</i> feelings, which I avail myself of this opportunity of
recording, we may commemorate an eminent individual in better ways than
by the erection of a statue; the philanthropist, by an alms-house&mdash;the
scholar, by scholarships&mdash;the naval commander, by a sea-mark&mdash;etc.
Admitting that a statue may sometimes be the most desirable form of
monument, the <i>statue</i> of an individual of whose features we are in
entire ignorance is a misnomer. It is scarcely less than an absurdity.</p>

<p>As I have intimated that there is no authentic portrait of Caxton, I
must now justify my conviction. Ames published a woodcut as a portrait
of our venerable Caxton:<a id="Caxton8"></a><a title="Go to footnote 8." href="#fn8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Dibdin discovered it to be a "portrait of
Burchiello,"<a id="Burch9"></a><a title="Go to footnote 9." href="#fn9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> an eccentric Florentine barber!&mdash;le poète le plus
bizarre qui ait jamais écrit! Horace Walpole published a print said to
represent earl Rivers "introducing Caxton to Edward IV."<a id="Ed10"></a><a title="Go to footnote 10." href="#fn10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It was
copied from an illuminated MS. in the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth,
No. 265. Now, what says Mr. Todd? "That Caxton <i>printed this book</i> in
1477, is well known. But what has that circumstance to do with the earl
<i>presenting or attending the presentation of his own manuscript</i>? The
figure here introduced by the earl is evidently, by the tonsure and
habit, a <i>priest</i>; which Caxton was not."<a id="not11"></a><a title="Go to footnote 11." href="#fn11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>  I have heard of no other
engraved portraits of Caxton.</p>

<p>Viewing Caxton as a man of considerable literary abilities, and as the
<i>first English printer</i>, I have now to propose for him a monument which
shall do justice to his merits in both capacities&mdash;a monument which
shall be visible at all times, and in all places: I propose a collective
impression of his original compositions. Such a volume would be the best
account of his life and works. It would also exhibit much of the
literary history of the times&mdash;some sound criticism and notions on
editorship&mdash;and curious specimens of the style of our forefathers. It
would comprise what no wealth could procure&mdash;what no single library
could produce. It would be, to use the forcible words of messieurs
Visconti and Castellan, on a somewhat similar occasion, "un monument
plus utile et plus durable que ceux même que l'on peut ériger avec le
marbre et le bronze."<a id="bronze12"></a><a title="Go to footnote 12." href="#fn12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> </p>

<p>The project now announced was formed by me, as to its principal

been communicated, however, in private, to the editor of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." To this fact I have no doubt he will cheerfully bear witness.
As the previous scheme of a <i>Caxton Testimonial</i> was then almost

<h3><span>SUPPOSED WITCHCRAFT.</span></h3>

<p>Cole, in his manuscript volume xlvi. p. 340, gives the copy of a paper
written at the beginning of the seventeenth century, addressed to some
Justices in Quarter Sessions, though of what county is not mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Maye it please your worships to understand what troubles,
   sicknesse, and losses the Petitioner hath suffered, and in what
   manner theye happened, and by plaine tokens and lyklyhood, by the
   meanes of this woman and others; but chiefly by her, as is
   gathered by all conjectures. And first of all, a Boare which I
   have, was in such case, that he could not crye nor grunt as
   beforetyme; neither could he goe, but creepe, until we used some
   meanes to recover him; but all was to no purpose, untill such
   tyme as we sent for Nicholas Wesgate, who, when he saw him, said,
   'He was madd or bewitched;' and my Wyfe using meanes to give him
   some Milke, he bit her by the hand, and I fearing he was madd,
   sent after my wyfe, being toward Norwich, that she might get
   something at the Apothecaries to prevent the danger we feared:
   and that Horse which my man did ryde upon after my wife, was
   taken lame as he returned back again, and suddenly after was
   swollen lyke a Bladder which is blown, and died within eight
   dayes. Nexte a Calfe was taken lame, the legg turning upward,
   which was a strange sight to them whoe did beholde the same.
   Suddenly after that I had fyve Calves more, which should have
   sold for xiij<i>s.</i> iiij<i>d.</i> the Calfe, being sound and well in the
   evening, and the next daye in the morning they were in such case
   as wee could not endure to come nigh them, by reason of a filthy
   noisome savour, theyre hayre standinge upright on theyre backes,
   and theye shakinge in such sorte as I never sawe, nor any other,
   I suppose, lyveynge. Againe within a short space I had another
   Calfe, which was taken so strangely, as if the backe were broken,
   and much swollen, and within the space of three or four dayes it
   dyed. And within two or three dayes after, another Calfe was
   taken in such sorte that it turned round about, and did goe as if
   the backe were broken. Then was I wished to burne it, and I
   carried the Calfe to burne it, and after it was burned, I was
   taken with paynes and gripings, and soe continued in such sort,
   untyll shee came to my House; whereupon I did earnestly chide
   her, and said I would beate her, and that daye, I prayse God, I
   was restored to my former health."

<h3><span>THE LATE SIR JOHN GRAHAM DALYELL, BARONET, OF BINNS, N.B.</span></h3>

<p>This learned and accomplished gentleman was born in 1776. He was
educated for the Scottish bar, to which he was called in the year 1797.
Within a year or two after he was enrolled as a member of the Faculty,
he produced his first quarto, <i>Fragments of Scottish History</i>. This was
followed, in the year 1801, by a collection of <i>Scottish Poems of the
Sixteenth Century</i>, in two octavo volumes. In 1809 appeared a <i>Tract
chiefly relative to Monastic Antiquities, with some Account of a recent
Search for the Remains of the Scottish Kings interred in the Abbey of
Dunfermline</i>, the first of four or five thin octavos, in which Mr.
Graham Dalyell called attention to those ecclesiastical records of the
north, so many of which have since been printed by the Bannatyne,
Maitland, and Spalding Clubs, under the editorial care of Mr. Cosmo
Innes. A later and more laborious work was his <i>Essay on the Darker
Superstitions of Scotland</i>; a performance which embodies the fruit of
much patient study in rare and little read works, and affords many
curious glimpses of the popular mythology of the north. The long list of
the productions of Sir John Graham Dalyell closes with his <i>Musical
Memoirs of Scotland</i>, published little more than a twelvemonth ago. The
deceased baronet was distinguished also by his acquaintance with
mechanical science, and still more by his knowledge of Natural History.
Of the zeal with which he prosecuted this last pursuit, he has left a
signal monument in his <i>Rare and Remarkable<a id="ble36"></a> <span class="pagenum">[36]</span> Animals of
Scotland</i>. Sir John succeeded to the family title and estates, as sixth
baronet, on the death of his elder brother, Sir James Dalyell, on
February 1, 1841. He had previously been advanced to the honours of
knighthood, by patent under the Great Seal, in the year 1836. He had
been for some time in infirm health, and died at his residence, Great
King Street, Edinburgh, on May 17, 1851, in his seventy-fourth year.
Dying unmarried, he is succeeded by his younger brother, now Sir William
Cunningham Cavendish Dalyell, of Binns, baronet, Commander R.N., Royal
Hospital, Greenwich.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "When it was only a confused mass of thoughts <i>tumbling</i> over one
   another in the dark; when the fancy was yet in its <i>first work</i>,

1828), where Dryden's Dedication to his <i>Rival Ladies</i> is quoted, and
<i>not</i> from the Dedication itself, as the <i>Retrospective Review</i> imagined

<h3><span>THE "EISELL" CONTROVERSY.</span></h3>

<p>When Polonius proposed to use the players according to their desert,
Hamlet rebuked him with "Much better man! use every man after his
desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour
and dignity!" I do not think it necessary to notice that what is merely
coarse and vulgar in an unprovoked attack upon myself, feeling that I
have no right to expect the man who has no consideration for his own
dignity to think of mine. But when an attempt is made to sow dissension
between me and those whose opinions I value, and whose characters I
esteem, I feel that in justice to myself and in satisfaction to them, a
few words are not out of place.</p>

<p>Some few of your readers may have seen a pamphlet in reply to
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, on the meaning of <i>eisell</i> and from certain insinuations about
"pegs and wires," and a "literary coterie," it might be supposed that
there existed some other bond for the support of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
than a common object affords. I wish then to inform such of them as may
not happen to belong to the "coterie" in question (which I suppose
exists somewhere&mdash;perhaps holds a sort of witch's-sabbath on some
inaccessible peak in the pamphleteer's imagination), that I have never,
to my knowledge, even seen either M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> or the editor of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>;" and that, so far from meaning offence to the angry gentleman
who seems disposed to run-a-muck against all who come in his way, I
actually supposed all meant in good part, and characterised his remarks
as "pleasant criticism."</p>

<p>From an apparent inability, however, of this pamphleteer to distinguish
between pleasantry and acrimony, he has attempted to fix on me offences
against others when I have ventured to dissent from their conclusions.
All I can say is, that I have never written anything inconsistent with
the very high respect I feel for the abilities and the great services
rendered by the gentlemen I have had occasion to allude to.</p>

<p>Dire is the wrath of the pamphleteer that he should have been charged by
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> with "want of truth." That gentleman doubtless saw what I did
not, the implied insinuation&mdash;since burst into full flower&mdash;about a
"coterie." Yet the candid controversialist, now, after due deliberation,
insinuates that a "canon of criticism," which I ventured to suggest, and
at which he now finds it convenient to sneer, was remembered for the
purpose of "bolstering up" M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span> "bad argument." So far from this
being the case, he knows that I used
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span> argument&mdash;at the close
of, and apart from the main purpose of my letter, to illustrate mine.
So, in another place, in the attempt to show up my "charming and
off-hand modesty," he quotes my opinion that<a id="that37"></a> <span class="pagenum">[37]</span> the meaning of
"rack" might be "settled at once and for ever," suppressing the fact
that I made the assertion with a view of "testing the correctness of my
opinion that the question was not one of etymology, but of construction.
In short, an adept in the use of those weapons which are of value only
where victory seems a higher aim than truth, his honesty would appear to
be upon a level with his taste.</p>

<p>I have now done with this gentleman. Of the importance of inquiries into
nice verbal distinctions there might be a question, but that they
sometimes furnish a clue to more valuable discoveries but for this fact
I should little regard them. At all events, the remark about the
difference "'twixt tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee," comes with strange
inconsistency from one who has written fifty-two pages with no other
result than raising the question whether "bitter" was not "sour," and
proving how both qualities may be combined in a truly "nauseous
medicament."</p>

<p class="blockquot">   [Our attention having, been directed by the preceding letter to

   deep pain, not for ourselves but for the writer. We are content
   to rest the justification of our conduct in abridging, or, as Mr.
   Causton terms it, "mutilating," that gentleman's communication,
   on the very passages which we omitted, and he has reprinted. Mr.
   Causton's pamphlet, written in defence of his literary
   reputation, proves that that reputation has no enemy so dangerous
   as himself. We may add that we propose next week publishing a
   summary of the evidence on both sides of this disputed question,

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span>"<i>Miserrimus.</i>"</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have an extraordinary little volume, which, I am
told, was written by Frederic Mansell Reynolds, who died in June, 1850,
entitled, "<i>Miserrimus</i>. On a gravestone in Worcester Cathedral is this
inscription, 'Miserrimus,' with neither name, date, nor comment.
 N<span class="smcap lowercase">OT</span> P<span class="smcap lowercase">UBLISHED</span>. Printed by Davison, Simmons, &amp; Co., 1832," 12mo.</p>

<p>The work purports to be a sort of autobiography of a most miserable
wretch, and we are left to suppose that his remains lie under the stone
in question, for we are not furnished with any preface or introduction.
Whether the author was aware of the name of the person over whom so
singular an inscription was placed does not appear; but there is no
reason to believe that the repulsive and painful aberrations he details
had any relation to the individual buried under the memorial of
"Miserrimus," whose name is recorded in Chambers's <i>Biographical
Illustrations of Worcestershire</i>, p. 310., as the Rev. Thomas Morris,
who was deprived of all ecclesiastical preferment for refusing to
acknowledge the king's supremacy at the Revolution, and died, it is
stated, in 1748, silvered over with the weight and infirmities of
eighty-eight years&mdash;"Miserrimus."</p>

<h4><span><i>The Dog and Duck, St. George's Fields.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It is not generally known,
that the <i>old stone sign</i> of that celebrated place of public resort is
still in existence, and is preserved by being imbedded in the brick wall
of the garden of Bedlam Hospital (visible from the road), representing a
dog squatting on his haunches with a duck in his mouth; and the date
1617. It was placed here on removal of the old house which stood on, or
very close to, the spot; and in the superintendent's (Mr. Nicholl's)
room is a very pretty drawing of that ancient place of amusement. I have
had a sketch made of it in large.</p>

<p>Any information respecting the Dog and Duck, its guests, visitors, or
landlords, would be most acceptable to</p>

<h4><span><i>The Habit of Profane Swearing by the English.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The revolting habit of
swearing&mdash;which, of late years, has happily diminished&mdash;has been a
marked characteristic of the English for <i>many centuries</i>; and the
national adjuration which has given us a <i>nick-name</i> on the continent,
appears to have prevailed at an earlier period than is generally
supposed.</p>

<p>"The English," observes Henry, "were remarkable in this period (between
1399 and 1485) among the nations of Europe, for the absurd and impious
practice of profane swearing in conversation."</p>

<p>The Count of Luxemburg, accompanied by the Earls of Warwick and
Stafford, visited the Maid of Orleans in her prison at Rouen, where she
was chained to the floor and loaded with irons. The Count, who had sold
her to the English, pretended that he had come to treat with her about
her ransom. After addressing him with contempt and disdain, she turned
her eyes towards the two Earls, and said,&mdash;"I know that you English are
determined to put me to death, and imagine that, after I am dead, you
will conquer France: but, though there were a hundred thousand <i>G&mdash;&mdash;
dammees</i> more in France than there are, they will never conquer that
kingdom." So early had the English got this odious nick-name by their
frequent and common use of that horrid and disgusting imprecation.</p>

<h4><span><i>Tennyson's Use of the Word "Cycle."</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A Moiety.&mdash;There is a line in
<i>Locksley Hall</i> which has always appeared to me a sad blemish in a fine
poem, and which may, perhaps, puzzle posterity as much as any of those
which have been illustrated<a id="ate38"></a> <span class="pagenum">[38]</span> by G. P. (Vol. iii., p. 319.) I
allude to that in stanza 92.:</p>


<div class="poem"><p>  "Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay."</p></div>


<p>Posterity will easily learn that the Chinese cycle was just "sixty
years," and will have some difficulty in believing that Tennyson should
have rated the disparity between life in Europe and in China no higher
than as six to five. It is evident that the poet used a "cycle" in the
signification of a long period of years; but will posterity be able to
find any authority for this use of the word? Can any one refer to a
dictionary which explains it in that sense, or to any other good author
who has so used it?</p>

<p>This use of the word "cycle" is associated in my mind with a use (or
rather <i>abuse</i>) of the word "moiety," which prevails in the north of
Ireland, and perhaps elsewhere. It properly signifies "one half," but
many employ it in the sense of a very small portion. I hope no one will
introduce it into poetry with this signification.</p>

<h2><span class="bla">Queries.</span></h2>


<h3><span>ETYMOLOGY OF FONTAINEBLEAU.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Description Routière et Géographique de l'Empire Français</i>, already
cited by me on the subject of Bicêtre, furnishes the following
particulars respecting the derivation of Fontainebleau:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Ce bassin sert de décharge à la fontaine, qui a donné, dit-on,
   son nom à Fontainebleau. Elle est nommée, dans les anciennes
   chartes, <i>Fons Blaudi</i>. Quelques modernes substituent à cette
   étymologie celle de <i>belle eau</i>, d'où ils font également dériver
   Fontainebleau. L'une et l'autre sont rejetées par Expilly, et
   remplacées par une troisième de sa façon, qui est évidente, selon
   lui, et qui, selon ses lecteurs, est la plus absurde de toutes.
   Je vais citer ce passage pour faire sentir jusqu'à quel travers
   d'esprit peut conduire la manie des étymologies. 'Pourquoi,'
   dit-il, 'se donner la torture à ce sujet? Il suffit de la moindre
   notion de la chasse pour savoir que, quand le chasseur appelle
   les chiens, il crie: <i>Thia hillaut!</i> N'est-il pas vraisemblable
   que le château ayant été bâti en pays de chasse, les habitans des
   environs, entendant continuellement le mot <i>hillaut</i>,
   l'appellèrent de ce nom, auquel ils joignirent celui de la
   fontaine près de laquelle il avait été bâti. De <i>Fontaine
   hillaut</i> on fit insensiblement Fontainebleau.'"</p>

<p>T<span class="smcap lowercase">WO</span> Queries suggest themselves here. Who or what was <i>Blaudus</i> or
<i>Blaudum</i>? Is our <i>Tally-ho</i> derived from <i>Thia hillaut</i>, or <i>vice
versâ</i>? As to the "travers d'esprit," so gravely imputed to Expilly, it
is clear to me that his solution of the matter must be taken as a
burlesque on etymologists, rather than as any evidence of his own
extravagance in that respect.</p>

<h3><span>FORCE OF CONSCIENCE.</span></h3>

<p>The following relation has often been reprinted in religious magazines
and the like. It is given by Dr. Fordyce, Professor of Philosophy at
Aberdeen, in his <i>Dialogues concerning Education</i> (London, 1748, vol.
ii. p. 401.), as "a true story, <i>which happened in a neighbouring state
not many years ago</i>." Can any of your readers furnish me with Dr. F.'s
authority for the assertion?&mdash;the Doctor himself gives none. One would
think that, if true, its truth might be easily verified. If its truth
cannot be satisfactorily established, to reprint such tales cannot but
be most mischievous:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "A jeweller of considerable wealth having occasion to travel to
   some distance from the place of his abode, took with him a
   servant in order to take care of his portmanteau. Having occasion
   to dismount on the road, the servant, watching his opportunity,
   took a pistol from his master's saddle and shot him dead on the
   spot; then rifled him of his money and jewels, and threw the body
   into the nearest river. With this booty he made off to a distant
   part of the country.... He was at length admitted to a share of
   the government of the town, and rose from one post to another,
   till at length he was chosen to be chief magistrate.... One day
   as he sat on the bench with some of his brethren in the
   magistracy, a criminal was brought before him who was accused of
   murdering his master. The evidence was full; the jury brought in
   their verdict that the prisoner was guilty; and the whole
   assembly awaited the sentence of the President of the court,
   which he happened to be on that day.... At length coming down
   from the bench he placed himself by the guilty man at the bar and
   made a full confession of his own guilt, and of all its
   aggravations.... We may easily suppose the great amazement of all
   the assembly, and especially of his fellow-judges. They
   proceeded, however, upon this confession, to pass sentence upon
   him, and he died with all the symptoms of penitent mind."</p>

<h3><span>ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE NORTH.</span></h3>

<p>English letters are exciting a daily increasing interest in the north of
Europe&mdash;that hardy and romantic country whence we ourselves are
descended. But their means for purchase are very scanty, and I have been
requested by the chief librarians of the Royal Library, Stockholm, and
the University Library, Copenhagen, to endeavour to procure them English
books <i>by gift</i> from private individuals and public societies and
libraries.</p>

<p>Can you assist me in this work by making this their prayer known in your
widely-spread columns?</p>

<p>Any English works, large or small, old or new, in any department of
literature, but especially in archæology, folk-lore, history, theology,
belles-lettres, &amp;c., particularly books <i>privately printed</i>, or
otherwise scarce or dear, will be most acceptable.<a id="acc39"></a> <span class="pagenum">[39]</span> Every donor
will have the goodness to state for which library his gift is intended.
So many have duplicates, or copies of books, which they no longer use or
need, that many will doubtless be able to assist in this pleasant
book-gathering for our Scandinavian cousins.</p>

<h4><span>6. <i>Bummaree or Bumaree.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;There is a large class of salesmen in
Billingsgate Market not recognised as such by the trade, but styled
Bumarees, who get a living by purchasing large parcels of fish of the
factor or common salesman, and selling it out in smaller quantities to
the fishmongers and other retailing buyers. This whole-sale retailing of
fish is also called bummareeing it, hence the name of these
(self-styled) salesmen.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find any clue to the meaning of this word thus
used in any authority that I possess, though the word has been
recognised in statutes and bye-laws of the markets for upwards of one
hundred years.</p>

<p>As I feel very interested in this matter, may I be allowed to call the
attention of some of your very learned correspondents to this matter,
and ask for the probable etymology and exact orthography of the word.</p>

<p>I have been informed that the only other use of the word known is with
the confectioners, who use <i>Bummaree</i> pans.</p>

<p>The prefix "bum" is used to express the lowest of the kind in
bum-bailiff, and also further additionally in connexion with selling in
"bum-boat." I cannot think that "bona venalia," goods set to sale, among
the Romans, give any clue to Bummaree. This, and other derivations
equally unsatisfactory, have been submitted by those who have hitherto
directed their attention to this subject.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "A troop of horse are riding along under the command of 'Duke

   the march; a strong lusty soldier laughs at, and insults him. He
   is allowed to demand satisfaction, and fight it out at once: he
   craves the loan of a sword; one is handed to him. But Donald had
   seen too many snows to trust his life to the blade of untried
   metal: he minutely examined the handle, the edge, the point, and
   the <i>spring</i>, and finally turning aside to <i>a pool</i> of water, and
   applying the <i>flat</i><a id="flat40"></a> <span class="pagenum">[40]</span> side of the blade to its surface,
   with one smart stroke broke it in two."</p>

<p>&mdash;Will any of your readers

"a man of war?" In Shakspeare the term is applied to Falstaff: Davy
inquires of Shallow:</p>

<div class="poem">    <p>  "Doth the man of war stay all night, Sir?"</p></div>

<p>And it is singular to remark, in the same scene, the first of Act V.,
the Second Part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, that the dinner ordered by Shallow for
Falstaff is just such as any country gentleman would now provide for an
unexpected guest:&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> Some pigeons, Davy; a couple of short-legged hens; a joint of
   mutton; and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook."</p>

<h4><span>15. <i>Secret Service Money of Charles II.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In Mr. Akerman's preface to

  <p class="blockquot"> "Amongst these (sums lavished on female favourites) the payments
   to the Duchess of Portsmouth are most conspicuous. No less a sum
   than 136,688<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> appears to have been bestowed by the
   profligate monarch on this woman <i>within the space of one
   year</i>."&mdash;See <i>Payments under the year 1681</i>, p. 42.</p>

<p>Now, on turning to the year and page designated, I find that the <i>whole
of the class</i> in which the Duchess's name appears amounts for <i>that
year</i> only to about 22,000<i>l.</i>, of which the Duchess of Portsmouth
appears to have received about 12,000 in several quarterly payments on
account of an annual pension or pensions of that amount: so in other
years. This is a very different sum from 136,000<i>l.</i> I would beg leave
to inquire of the editor, or of any of your <i>Camdenite</i> correspondents,
whether there is an error in Mr. Akerman's statement, or only in my way
of reading it?</p>

lease from the prior of St. John of Jerusalem to Cardinal Wolsey of
their manor of Hampton Court, it having been in the possession of the

<h3><span>WRITTEN SERMONS AND EXTEMPORE PREACHING.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 478. 526.; Vol. iv., p. 8.)</span></h3>

<p>Your versatile correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span> has been led astray by an
incorrect assertion of Bingham's (magni nominis vir), that Origen was
the first who preached extempore. The passage to which Bingham refers
us, in Eusebius, asserts nothing of this sort; but simply that Origen
would not suffer his sermons to be taken down by the short-hand writers
till he was sixty years old,&mdash;a sufficient proof, if any were needed,
that the custom of taking down sermons by notaries in the third century
was not unusual.</p>

<p>Some rogue has stolen my Number of the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" in which the
inquiry on the subject of written sermons was made; but, if I remember
rightly, the <i>question</i> was put correctly, it having been asked when
written sermons were first preached. As I at one time took some pains to
look into this point, and as no one else seems inclined to take it up,
perhaps you will allow me space for a few remarks.</p>

<p>1. I suppose no one will be disposed to question the extreme
improbability of the "sermons" in the Apostolic are having been
<i>written</i> discourses: if, however, this be considered doubtful, I am
willing to argue the point, and be set right if I am wrong in thinking
it unquestionable.</p>

<p>2. I believe it is almost as improbable, that in what Professor Brunt
calls the "post-Apostolic" times sermons were written, not only from the
complete silence of the Apostolic Fathers on the point&mdash;for that would
really prove next to nothing,&mdash;but because it seems quite incredible
that no vestige of any such sermon should have come down to us; no
forgery of one, no legend or tradition of the existence of one if the
practice of writing sermons had prevailed at all.</p>

<p>3. In the Apologies of Justin and Tertullian [Justin, ed. Otto, i. 270.;
Tertullian, <i>Ap.</i> ch. xxxix.] there is a description of the addresses
delivered in the congregations of their times, which appears to me to
prove that they knew of no such practice as reading a sermon and the
passage from Origen contra Cels., which De la Cerda gives in his note on
Tertullian, though it is only quoted in the Latin, surely shows the same
(vol. i. p. 190.). I came across something of the sort in Cyprian about
two years ago and, if I may dare trust my memory, it appeared to me at
the time to be more satisfactory than the passages above referred to;
but I made no note of it,&mdash;and I was hunting for other game when I met
with it. Still, if your<a id="your42"></a> <span class="pagenum">[42]</span> querist is going into the subject as a
student into a matter of history, I dare stay I could find the
paragraph.</p>

<p>4. I have really no acquaintance with the post-Nicene fathers, the mere
desultory reading out of some few of the works of the Arian period
counting for something less than nothing; but, as far as secondary
sources are to be trusted, I certainly never met with anything that
would lead me to conclude that sermons were ever read in the fourth or
fifth centuries. [I shall come to the only shadow of an argument in
favour of such a practice having prevailed so early, presently.]
Certainly, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, St. Chrysostom, St. Cyril of
Jerusalem, were extempore preachers by Bingham's showing. Gregory the
Great, much later, for all that appears to the contrary, never wrote his
sermons at all, and even preached his homilies on Ezekiel almost without
any preparation. Indeed the prevalence of that most abominable system of
applauding the preacher, which St. Chrysostom protests against in the
magnificent sermon on 1Cor.xiv.38., could scarcely have been universal
where sermons were read.</p>

<p>5. I come now to the argument which Bingham deduces from a passage in
Sidonius Apollinaris; where, in speaking of Faustus, Bishop of Riez, he
says that he was "raucus plausor," while hearing "tuas prædicationes,
nunc repentinas, nunc, cum ratio poposcisset, elucubratas." Until I had
turned up the passage itself, I thought there was no doubt that Bingham
was right in explaining it as referring partly to extempore, partly to
written-and-read sermons; but taking the passage as it stands, I would
submit that the "prædicationes elucubratas" were not at all <i>read</i>
sermons, though prepared and studied beforehand, and that the
"prædicationes repentinas" were such as St. Augustine sometimes
delivered, viz., on a text which suggested itself to him during the time
of service, or in consequence of some unforeseen event having happened
just before his ascending the pulpit.</p>

<p>6. I have as yet dealt only with the negative evidence; but the positive
testimony against the reading, and in favour of the reciting or
preaching sermons, is far from small. I should look upon man as crazy
who ventured to speak slightingly of Bingham, and should as soon think
of setting up myself against that great man as of challenging Goliah of
Gath to fisty-cuffs; but I can never get rid of the thought that Bingham
had a strong prejudice against extempore preaching, and treated the
history of sermons somewhat unfairly: <i>e.g.</i>, in his 22nd section of
that 4th chap. of the xivth book (with which chap. I take it for granted
my readers are acquainted), he somewhat roguishly misrepresents Mabillon
and the Council of Vaison; and as to every other passage he quotes or
refers to, every one asserts that the sermons were to be preached or
<i>recited</i>, not one says a word about reading.</p>

<p>The Council of Vaison is, of course, that which was held in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 529,
and at which Cæsarius of Arles presided: but the 2nd canon does not say
a word about reading; so far from it, it commands that the homilies
which the deacons preached should be recited [<i>recitentur</i>, Labbe, iv. p
1679.], as though the practice of reading a sermon were not known. So,
with regard to the other passages from St. Augustine, there is not a
hint about reading: if a man could not make his own sermons, he was to
take another's; but to take care to commit it to memory, and then
deliver it.</p>

<p>I should be glad to furnish you with a few "more last words" on this
subject, but I fear that these remarks have already proceeded to too
great a length: still, if you give me any encouragement, I should like
to take up the matter again.</p>

<p>I should be glad to be informed whether it be true, as I have heard,
that the practice of learning their sermons by heart is universal and
avowed by the preachers in Germany; and whether it be really a common
thing for a preacher there to deny himself on a Saturday, on the plea
that he is getting his sermon by heart?</p>

<h3><span>FEST SITTINGS.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 328. 396.)</span></h3>

<p>Not questioning the meaning given to the word <i>Fest</i> by R. V<span class="smcap lowercase">INCENT</span>, I
take leave to refer you to Dr. Willan's list of words in use in the
mountainous districts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, in the
seventeenth volume of the <i>Archæologia</i>. You will there find: "F<span class="smcap lowercase">EST</span>, to
board from home." The word is used in that sense at the present time. A
gentleman resident in the West Riding writes to me:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"I have heard the term 'fest' used generally as applying to
   sending out cattle to pasture, and so says Carr in his <i>Dialect
   of Craven</i>. I have also frequently heard it used in this manner:
   'I have fest my lad out apprentice to so and so.' In my own
   neighbourhood, in the West Riding, it is a frequent practice for
   poor man who possesses a cow, but no pasture, to 'fest' her with
   some occupier of land at a certain sum by the week, or for some
   other term. So a gamekeeper is said 'to fest' his master's
   pointer, when he agrees with a farmer to keep it for a time. In
   these cases the boy, the cow, the pointer, 'are boarded from
   home.'"</p>


<p>As to "statutes" or "sittings," the word<a id="word43"></a> <span class="pagenum">[43]</span> "statutes" is explained
in Blount's <i>Dictionary</i> as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "It is also used in our vulgar discourse for the Petty Sessions
   which are yearly kept for the disposing of servants in service by
   the statute 5 Eliz. chap. iv." (§ 48.)</p>

<p>See in the <i>Archaic and Provincial Dictionary</i>, "S<span class="smcap lowercase">ITTINGS</span>" and
"S<span class="smcap lowercase">TATUTE</span>." In Holderness (I collect it from the Query of F. R. H.) the
term "sittings" is used in the same sense as "statute" in the West
Riding, and in many other parts of the kingdom. "Fest sittings" appear
then to mean "the annual assemblage of servants who hire themselves to
board from home." In many places the "statute" or "stattie" is connected
with the fair.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Statute Fairs," my friend writes, "are held at Settle, Long
   Preston, and other places, which don't occur to me, in our
   district (Craven). At Settle servants wishing to hire stand with
   a small white wand in their hands, to show their object. In like
   manner horses, when taken to a fair, wear on their heads a white
   leather kind of bridle; and (to come nearer home) when a young
   lady has attained a certain age, and begins to look with anxious
   eye to future prospects, we say that she also has put on the
   white bridle."</p>

<p>He adds: "I have myself had servants hired at Long Preston Statute
Fair." Another friend writes to me:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Richmond Statties are very famous, every servant desirous of
   hiring having a peeled twig or stick. At Penrith they put a straw
   in their mouths. I remember a poor girl being killed by an
   infuriated cow at Penrith; and the poor thing had the straw in
   her mouth when dead."</p>

<p>In the East Riding, Pocklington Statute is well known; and York has its
Statute Fair. At these "statutes" or "statties" ("Stattie Fairs" and
"Sittings," or Fest Sittings), servants "fest themselves," that is, hire
themselves to board from home.</p>

<p>Standing in the market-place to be hired will occur to any one who may
take the trouble of reading these desultory observations.</p>

<p>Excuse my adding irrelevantly the following use of the word "sitting."
It is said that a young man is "sitting a young woman," when he is
wooing or courting her.</p>

<h3><span>HISTOIRE DES SÉVÉRAMBES.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 4. 72. 147. 374.)</span></h3>

<p>In Quérard's <i>France Littéraire</i> (Didot, Paris, 1839), tome x. p. 10., I
read the following notice of the author of <i>Histoire des Sévérambes</i>:&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "Vairasse (Denis) d'Alais, écrivain français du XVII. Siècle.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"&mdash;&mdash; Grammaire raisonnée et méthodique, contenant en abrégé les
   principes de cet art et les règles les plus nécessaires de la

  <p class="blockquot">"Cet ouvrage a été réimprimé dans la collection des Voyages
   imaginaires."</p>


<p><i>La France Littéraire</i> is a compilation of extraordinary labour and
research; and, in the absence of more authentic information, I believe
we may safely rely on the above statement. The facts, therefore, in so
far as they have been brought to light, may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The original work was written in English, was entitled <i>History of
the Sevarites</i>, and published in 1675.</p>

<p>2. That work suggested the idea of the <i>Histoire des Sévérambes</i>, which
was published in 1677-9, and in all essential respects may be said to be
an original composition.</p>

<p>3. The Captain <i>Liden</i> of one edition, and the Captain <i>Siden</i> of
another (from whose memoirs the work is said to have been translated),
are one and the same imaginary personage.</p>

<p>4. The author of the <i>History of the Sevarites</i> has not been
ascertained; the claims of Vairasse, Algernon Sidney, and Isaac Vossius,
being founded on mere conjecture.</p>

<p>5. There seems no reason to doubt that Denis Vairasse d'Alais was the
author of <i>Histoire des Sévérambes</i>; supported as that opinion is by the
testimony of Christian Thomasius, Barbier, and Quérard.</p>

<h3><span>SALTING THE DEAD.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 6.)</span></h3>

<p>An amusing instance of this custom&mdash;perhaps even now, under certain
circumstances, prevalent in some parts of England&mdash;occurs in Mrs. Bray's
<i>Letters on the Superstitions, &amp;c. of Devonshire</i>. A traveller while
passing over one of the large uninclosed tracts of land near Tavistock,
was overtaken by a violent snowstorm, which compelled him to seek a
night's shelter from the inhabitants of a lonely cottage on the moor. In
the chamber assigned for his repose, he observed a curiously carved oak
chest of antique appearance.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "He noticed or made some remarks upon it to the old woman who had
   lighted him up stairs, in order to see that all things in his
   room might be as comfortable as circumstances would permit for
   his rest. There was something he thought shy and odd about the
   manner of the woman when he observed the chest; and after she was
   gone, he had half a mind to take a peep into it."</p>

<p>After a while he does, and <i>horribile dictu!</i> a<a id="dictu44"></a> <span class="pagenum">[44]</span> human corpse,
stiff and cold, lay before his sight! After a night spent in the most
agonizing apprehensions he descends to breakfast, and his fears become
somewhat lightened by the savoury fumes of the morning meal.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Indeed so much did he feel reassured and elevated by the
   extinction of his personal fears, that, just as the good woman
   was broiling him another rasher, he out with the secret of the
   chest, and let them know that he had been somewhat surprised by
   its contents; venturing to ask, in a friendly tone, for an
   explanation of so remarkable a circumstance. 'Bless your heart,
   your honour, 'tis nothing at all,' said her son; 'tis only
   fayther!'&mdash;'Father! your father!' cried the traveller; 'what do
   you mean?'&mdash;'Why, you know, your honour,' replied the peasant,
   'the snaw being so thick, and making the roads so cledgy like,
   when old fayther died, two weeks agon, we couldn't carry un to
   Tavistock to bury un, and so mother put un in the old box, and
   salted un in: mother's a fine hand at salting un in.'"&mdash;Vol. i.
   pp. 29. 32.</p>

<p>In connexion with this subject you will perhaps permit me to observe,
that the custom of placing a plate of salt on the body is still retained
in many parts of the country. An instance of its use in the metropolis
came under my notice only last week. The reason assigned for this is,
that it prevents the spread of any noxious vapours. But query, is it not
an ancient superstitious observance? According to Moresin:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Salem abhorrere constat diabolum et ratione optima nititur, quia
   Sal æternitatis est et immortalitatis signum, neque putredine
   neque corruptione infestatur unquam, sed ipse ab his omnia
   vendicat."&mdash;<i>Moresini Papatus</i>, p. 154.</p>

<h4><span><i>Bogatsky</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 478.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A very satisfactory biographical

<h4><span><i>Baronette</i></span><span> (Vol. iii., p. 450.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Selden was of opinion that Baronet
was used for Banneret, as may be seen in the following extracts from the
second part of <i>Titles of Honor</i>.</p>

<p>Chap. iii. sect. 23.:</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "Bannerets ... some have stiled them Baronets, as if they had a
   diminitive title of Barons."</p>


<p>Chap. v. sect. 25.:</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "And whereas in the statutes of the same King" (Richard II.), "as
   we read them in English, every Archbishop, Bishop, Abbot, Prior,
   Duke, Earl, Baron, Baronet, Knight of the Shire, &amp;c., are
   commanded under paine of amerciament or other punishment,
   according to ancient use, to appear in Parlament; the French,
   both of the Roll and of those Books that are truly printed, hath
   Banneret and by some little mistake Barneret for the same word.
   And as when mention is in the old stories of Knight Banneret, the
   word Baronet (which runnes easier from the tongue) is often for
   Banneret; so fell it not only in the English print of our
   statutes, but also in a report of a case that is of a later time
   than that to which our present division confines us, that Baronet
   (for Banneret) is likewise used for a Baron. For in an attaint
   under Henry the Sixt, one of the Jury challenged himselfe because
   his ancestors had been Baronets and Seigneurs des Parlements. I
   cannot doubt but that the title of Banneret in this sense was
   meant there."</p>

<p>Chap. v. sect. 39.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "Of the name of Banneret as it sometimes expressed a Baron of
   Parlament enough is before said. And as in that notion of it,
   Baronet was often miswritten for it, so also in this." (Milites

   frequent for Banneretti, but even in a patent passed to Sir Ralph
   Fane, a Knight-Banneret under Edward the Sixt, he is called
   Baronettus for Bannerettus."</p>

<h4><span><i>Rifles</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 517.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In reply to A. C., I can safely assert
that the <i>best</i> American rifles are nearly equal, in point of
workmanship, to the <i>common</i> ones made in Birmingham, and that there is
no "<i>use for which an American rifle is to be preferred to an English</i>,"
French, or Belgian one; and further, that the American rifles will not
bear comparison with those of any London maker.</p>

<p>Colt's revolvers were submitted to our Government twelve or fourteen
years ago, and not approved. The present revolvers, made in England,
have always been considered improvements upon them.</p>

"Christian Lady" should have been guilty of such a shameless, heartless
act of literary piracy.</p>

<h4><span><i>English Sapphics</i></span><span> (Vol. iii., p. 494.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the translation of the
Psalms of David by Sir P. Sidney and his sister, the Countess of
Pembroke, the 125th Psalm is rendered in Sapphics. The first stanza is
as follows:</p>

    <div class="poem">  <p>"As Sion standeth very firmly steadfast,</p>
      <p>Never once shaking: so on high Jehova</p>
     <p> Who his hope buildeth, very firmly steadfast</p>
                                   <p class="i11"> Ever abideth."</p></div>


<p>The 120th Psalm is in Alcaics, and, I think, very successful,
considering the difficulty of the metre. It commences thus:</p>

   <div class="poem"> <p>  "As to th' Eternall often in anguishes</p>
    <p>  Erst have I called, never unanswered,</p>
       <p class="i3"> Againe I call, againe I calling</p>
      <p class="i3">  Doubt not againe to receave an answer."</p></div>

<p>There are also specimens of other Latin metres in the same collection.</p>

<p>I remember about eighteen or twenty years ago an "Ode to December," in
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, the first stanza of which was as follows (I
quote from memory):</p>

   <div class="poem">  <p> "O'er the bare hill tops moan the gusty breezes,</p>
     <p> From the dark branches sweeping the sere leaves,</p>
     <p> South comes the polar duck; and the gliding grey gull</p>
                            <p class="i9">Shrieks to her shelter."</p></div>

<h4><span><i>Bellarmin's Monstrous Paradox</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., p. 497.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In your paper of
June 21st, there is a question inserted as to the precise text in which
Cardinal Bellarmin is said to maintain that "should the Pope command the
commission of vice, and forbid the practice of virtue, it would become
the duty of Catholics to perform the one and to avoid the other." To
that question you have replied by quoting a passage from the fourth book
of the cardinal's great work. It is quite true that the words quoted by
you occur at that place; it is quite as untrue that the "monstrous
paradox" is there attempted to be maintained. A reference to the book
will show at once that this paradox is simply used as an argument to
enable the cardinal to prove his point by the common method of a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. If what I maintain, says the cardinal, is false,
then it follows that "should the Pope," &amp;c. Of course, the rest of the
argument fully stated would be: But this consequence is not true,
therefore neither is the antecedent true; that is to say, "what I
maintain" is true. So that instead of maintaining in this passage the
monstrous paradox alleged, the cardinal, in reality, is only quoting it
as a monstrous absurdity, which he himself <i>condemns</i>, and which would
result from the contradiction of his proposition. In justice to the
memory of a great man, who has been much and most unjustly slandered
upon this very point, may I ask for the insertion of this letter.</p>

<h4><span><i>Jonah and the Whale</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 517.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;E. J. K. probably founds
his unqualified rejection of the word "whale" on the English version, as
a presumed more correct interpretation of the corresponding term in the
original Hebrew. But it should not be forgotten, that the equal, or
perhaps superior authority of the Seventy translators, to that of our
best modern interpreters, is becoming daily more apparent. At all
events, without a reference to such collateral aid, it is scarcely safe
to pronounce on the meaning of any word or passage in the Old Testament.
On this subject, among many other works, may be consulted the valuable
Lexicon of the Rev. Dr. Wilson, Canon of Winchester; and the learned
<i>Apology for the Septuagint</i>, by the Rev. E. W. Grinfield.</p>

<p>In the present case, it is certainly of little consequence, whether the
Greek word
 <ins title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>,
and the Latin <i>cetus</i>, be translated "whale,"
or "great fish," both of which may be comprehended under them. Though
the former is the usual interpretation, and though the English
translators employ the term "great fish" in the passages
 "<ins title="[Greek: Kai prosetaxe Kyrios Kêtei megalô]">&#922;&#945;&#8054;
 &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8051;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#949;
 &#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;
 &#954;&#8053;&#964;&#949;&#953;
 &#956;&#949;&#947;&#8049;&#955;&#8179;</ins>,"
and
"<ins title="[Greek: en tê koilia tou kêtous]">&#7952;&#957;
 &#964;&#8135;
&#954;&#959;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#8115;
&#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#954;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962;</ins>,"
the commonly accepted word seems more in accordance with an authority of
unquestionable importance.</p>

  <p class="right">    C. H. P.</p>

  <p class="left">   Brighton, June 28. 1851.</p>

<p>It must have escaped the memory of your correspondent E. J. K., in
speaking of the supposed error of calling the "great fish" which
swallowed Jonah a "whale," that our Lord, in giving this sign to the
Jews, calls it in our English version a "whale"
(<ins title="[Greek: tou kêtous]">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962;</ins>,
St. Matt. xii. 40., this being the word used in the Septuagint version,
from which the Evangelists quoted the SS. of the Old Testament).</p>

<p>Surely then there is not any <i>popular</i> error in the term "whale" as
expressing the "great fish" of the prophet Jonah, for your correspondent
does not go beyond the English version, nor can I say what the word used
in the original Hebrew would strictly signify. <ins title="[Greek: Kêtos]">&#922;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>, it is
true, may not, and probably does not, mean anything more definite than
the "great fish" of the Hebrew; but certainly our translators, by
adopting the term "whale" in the Gospels, have so sanctioned the
interpretation, that the error, if such, must be referred to them, and
not to any later period, and therefore can hardly be reckoned amongst
those of the <i>popular</i> class.</p>

  <p class="left">  Walthamstow, June 30. 1851</p>

<p>Great disputes have been raised what the fish was. As it is called a
whale in the Septuagint,<a id="gint46"></a> <span class="pagenum">[46]</span> and in St. Matthew, xii. 40., one can
hardly call it a vulgar error to speak of it commonly as a whale.</p>

<p><i>The Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, with a Supplement,
containing the Condemnations of the Early Reformers, and other matters
relating to the Council. Literally translated into English by</i> Theodore
Alois Buckley, B.A., of <i>Christ Church, Oxford</i>, is the title of a
volume which has just been issued; and which many of our readers will
probably consider a very well-timed volume. It is not, however, because
we admit with Mr. Buckley that "to try Rome fairly we must hear her
plead her own cause" (for with polemics we have nothing to do), that we
direct their attention to it; but because we agree with him that the
Decrees and Canons of the Council of Trent are documents as valuable in
a legal and historical, as in a religious point of view, and because
there must be many who would gladly learn what these Canons and Decrees
were, yet are not acquainted with the language in which they were
originally recorded. By such persons Mr. Buckley's name on the
title-page may be received as a sufficient guarantee of the accuracy of
the present translation.</p>

opinion, contain internal evidence of having been written within the
last year of the Reformer's life, are accompanied by Notes and a copious
Glossary; and the work has been undertaken not without a hope that the
publication of these Treatises may direct the attention of influential
scholars to the importance of collecting and printing all the existing
writings which remain in our libraries under the name of Wycklyffe and
his followers. We sincerely trust that this hope will soon be realised.</p>

and HISTORICAL MSS. of M. A<span class="smcap lowercase">LCIDE</span> D<span class="smcap lowercase">ONNADIEU</span>. The importance of this
Collection cannot be estimated by a mere list of names, as in every
instance, with a few exceptions where extreme rarity has precluded
choice, each specimen has been selected for its intrinsic literary or
historic worth. Among the English Royal Personages are the Autographs of
Henry V., Henry VI., Edward IV., Richard III., and Henry VII.; (from
this period, nearly all are Letters entirely Autograph of) Henry VIII.,
Catherine of Aragon, Catherine Parr, Edward VI., Queen Mary and Philip
of Spain, Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley,
James I. and Anne of Denmark, Henry Prince of Wales, Charles I. as Duke
of York and as King; also, a Document of the greatest Interest, the
Contract of Marriage between Charles I. and the Infanta of Spain, signed
by the parties&mdash;Henrietta Maria, Mary Princess of Orange, daughter of
Charles I.; Elizabeth Queen of Bohemia, Frederic King of Bohemia and his
Sons, Prince Rupert, Louisa Princess of Bohemia, her well-known Letter
in Hieroglyphics, Oliver Cromwell, Letters and Documents, and
particularly the original Order to the Lord Mayor of London, directing
him to proclaim Oliver Cromwell Lord Protector of England&mdash;Richard
Cromwell, Charles II., Catherine of Braganza, James II., the Depositions
concerning his Marriage with Anne Hyde, signed by the parties; Mary
d'Este, James III., the Pretender; William III., Queen Mary, George I.,
and the rest of the House of Hanover to the present Sovereign. All these
Letters, and indeed the whole of the Collection, are in the highest
preservation, and notwithstanding the great rarity of many, several
specimens of most are included. There are Autographs of the Regicides,
temp. Charles I., and unique Letters of the Conspirators Robert Aske and
Robert Catesby. The French Royal Series commences with an extremely rare
and important Autograph of Charles VII., and continues to the close of
the Monarchy. Of Henry IV. alone there are twenty important Letters.
Other Foreign Sovereigns, including the Bonaparte family, several of
Napoleon, particularly a <i>plein pouvoir</i> to Caulincourt, enabling him to
conclude a Treaty of Peace with the Allied Powers at the critical period
of January, 1814&mdash;Christina of Sweden, Catherine of Aragon, Catherine
and other of the House of Medici, Diane de France, John sans Peur, 1410,
Jeanne d'Albret, Louise de Savoie, Marguerite d'Autriche, Margaret
Daughter of Francis I., Sovereign Princes of the House of Nassau, &amp;c.
Amongst the Ecclesiastics may be named a Holograph letter of Pope
Clement VIII., the Père Joseph, Janssenius, Martin Luther (about
Purgatory), Père la Chaise, Cardinal Mazarin, St. Francis de Sales, St.
Vincent de Paul, &amp;c. The Autographs of Literary Men include P. Aretino,
Lord Bacon (two), Boileau, Conrart, Fontenelle, Thomas Lord Fairfax, his
Autograph Translation of "Mercurius Trismagistus Pimander"&mdash;Kepler,
Lafontaine, Molière (unique), Mirabeau, Marmontel, Malherbe, Newton,
Peiresc, J. J. Rousseau, Scaliger, Salmasius, Sannazarus, Thuanus, B.
Tasso, Visconti, Voltaire, Vespucius, Winckelmann, &amp;c. Amongst the
Artists are Ph. de Champagne, Perrault, Poussin, Rubens, Rembrandt,
Raphael d'Urbino, P. Veronese, Sir C. Wren (about building the
Monument). To this very imperfect sketch of the contents of this
important Collection may be added Autographs of Calas, Clairon, Sir F.
Drake (papers relative to his descent upon the Spaniards), Richard
Hakluyt, Robert Devereux Earl of Essex (Letter supplicating his Life),
La Noue, "Bras de Fer," Duke of Monmouth (Letter supplicating his Life),
Caesar, Nostradamus, Sir W. Raleigh, the Chancellor Seguier, Duke of
Sully, the Sforzas, Edmund de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk and his brother

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
